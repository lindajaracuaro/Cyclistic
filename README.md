Exploring User Behavior: Annual Members vs. Casual Riders -  A Comparative Analysis of Cyclistic Bike Trips to discover how annual members and casuals use Cyclistic bikes differently

Join me on a journey of data-driven discovery at Cyclistic, Chicago's premier bike-share company. I'm a junior data analyst, and our team is on a mission to increase annual memberships. We're delving deep into a treasure trove of meticulously collected data from August 2022 to July 2023.

With a keen eye for accuracy, we've meticulously cleaned and manipulated the data to uncover hidden gems of insights. We've left no stone unturned, excluding zero-distance rides, creating the 'ride_length' variable for precise analysis, and even categorizing rides by 'time_of_day' and 'season.'

The result? A goldmine of findings! We've discovered that annual members are weekday warriors, while casual riders love weekend adventures. We've also unlocked the secret of electric bikes' popularity.

But that's not all! The next steps involve tapping into user feedback, launching targeted marketing campaigns, and even collecting survey responses to fine-tune our strategy.

With compelling data insights and professional visualizations, we're set to pave the way for Cyclistic's future success. I'd love to share more in an interview. Are you ready to ride with us to success?
